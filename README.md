* **Data Refresh:** Nightly cron (Dockerized) parses daily JSON, updates MongoDB, runs embedding jobs into Qdrant.
* **Chat/RAG:** Each chat request first hits a Qdrant retrieval for context (stock, news, themes, user), then LLM completion.
* **Raw Data:** All uploaded/parsed JSONs stored in raw form, mapped to processed records (for audit, backfill, future features).

2. **Parse & Transform:** Extracts stocks, themes, news, financials, mappings.
3. **Store Processed:** Upserts into MongoDB collections; maps references.
4. **Store Raw:** Backs up entire JSON (compressed) in Mongo GridFS (raw\_json\_backup).
5. **Embedding:** All new/updated text fields run through embedding model, stored in Qdrant.
6. **Audit Trail:** All changes timestamped, with reference to raw file and parser version.
7. **Schema Evolution:** All collections versioned for migration/future backfill.
